            <h3>Web Automation Using Selenium</h3>
            <p>Selenium is a set of tools and libraries that used to automate web applications across different platforms 
                using different programming languages. In simple words, selenium provides tools that can interact with the 
                browser and can automate browser actions like click, select, input, navigate, etc. with the help of scripts.
                 Testing done with the help of the Selenium tool is referred to as Selenium Testing. Selenium is free and Open Source tool. 
                 It is the most widely used open-source solution for test automation of web applications..</p>

            <h3>API Automation Using Rest Azured</h3>
            <p>Rest Assured is a Java-based library for automating tests on RESTful APIs. It simplifies making HTTP requests (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) and validating responses, making it ideal for
                 developers and QA testers. With built-in support for JSON and XML parsing, Rest Assured allows easy assertion and validation of API responses. It also integrates well with testing frameworks 
                 like JUnit and TestNG, supporting behavior-driven development (BDD) for better readability.
                 Rest Assured handles various authentication methods, such as OAuth and Basic Auth, and works well with CI/CD pipelines, enhancing efficiency in continuous API testing and ensuring 
                 reliable software delivery.</p>

            <h3>The Role of a QA Automation Engineer</h3>
            <p>A QA Automation Engineer plays a critical role in ensuring the quality and reliability of software by automating repetitive testing tasks. Their main
                 responsibility is to create, maintain, and execute automated test scripts that validate the functionality, performance, and security of applications.
                 By designing automated test cases, they reduce manual testing time, increase test coverage, and help catch bugs early in the development lifecycle.

                QA Automation Engineers work closely with development and QA teams to understand requirements, set up testing environments, and integrate automated tests into CI/CD pipelines for continuous testing. They use tools like Selenium, Rest Assured, and Appium to automate tests across web, API, and mobile applications. Their work is essential for accelerating release cycles, maintaining high software standards, and enabling teams to deliver robust products quickly and efficiently, ultimately improving the user experience.</p>
